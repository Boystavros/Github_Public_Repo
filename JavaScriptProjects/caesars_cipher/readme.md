<h1> Caesar's Cipher Application</h1>

<h3> PURPOSE OF PROJECT: </h3>

This was my solution to one of the five problems posed for the FreeCodeCamp.org 'JavaScript 
Algorithms and Data Structures' certification.

The problem was decribed on FreeCodeCamp.org as:

> One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. 
> In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
>
> A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. 
> Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
>
> Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
>
> All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), 
> but do pass them on.

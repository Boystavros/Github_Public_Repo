<h1> Level Crossing Application </h1>

<h3> PURPOSE OF PROJECT: </h3>

This was my solution to a University Assignment question (from 1st Hons year of BSc Computing & IT) that demonstrates my understanding of object orchestration and exception handling in Java.

This question involved completing a class called LevelCrossingController, instances of which coordinate the warning lights for a level crossing system to warn of the barriers coming down as a train approaches. 
First a single orange light is lit, and then a pair of red lights flash on and off together. This question only considered the lights on one side of the crossing and the motion of any train was outside its scope.

We were provided with the complete class Light in the supplied project and this class was not to be changed. We were asked to look at the code for this carefully and ensure that when writing methods we didn't repeat functionality already provided.

We were asked to write code exclusively in the LevelCrossingController class but to familiarise ourselves with code for the Light class to ensure wedidn't repeat functionality already provided. 

This LevelCrossingController class decides which lights should be showing which colour at what point when a train approaches.

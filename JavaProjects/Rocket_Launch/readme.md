<h1> Rocket Launch Application </h1>

<h3> PURPOSE OF PROJECT: </h3>

This was my solution to a University Assignment question (from 1st Hons year of BSc Computing & IT) that 
demonstrates my understanding of selection, repetition, dialogue boxes, code reuse and composition in Java.

In this project we were asked to complete a class called Rocket. 

Once completed this class produces a simple animated rocket (in 
a BlueJay graphics window) that performs a launch sequence and moves vertically up the screen at a speed based on the user's input.

**Test inputs for this application can be found in [testdata.md](https://github.com/Boystavros/Github_Public_Repo/blob/master/JavaProjects/Rocket_Launch/testdata.md)**

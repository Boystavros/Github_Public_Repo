The project brief was to produce a basic announcments page for a walking club's admin application. 
We were to use only HTML and CSS (no JS or PHP) and the forms are submitted to the OU reflector.
All elements were to be visible but were not required to function, so Nav and logout do not do anything.

The page was to be viewable at two screen widths only (not between or outside these sizes):
1024px wide, landscape orientation
375px wide, portrait orientation
